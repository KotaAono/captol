## Captol
Captol is a python-based GUI application for reconstructing screen-sharing documents.

## Usage
When you start "uitk.py", a GUI window will open.

You can use "1. Extract" tab to specify the destination and range of the clip area, and click "Set" to complete the camera preparation.

Press the clip button to save the image of the specified area in sequential numbers.

"2. Merge" tab allows you to save the images as a single pdf file with a password if necessary.


To encrypt and decrypt pdf with password, you need to install "qpdf" and make a pass beforehand.
